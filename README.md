This code sets up a Django project in Google Colab for an e-commerce marketplace. It begins by installing necessary packages and creating a Django project structure. The code then adds the project root to the Python path and sets the Django settings module. It modifies the settings.py file to allow Colab as a host, ensuring the application can run in the Colab environment. The script proceeds to run database migrations, creating the necessary tables in the database. A superuser is created for administrative access. Finally, the Django development server is started on a specified port. To make the server accessible from Colab, the code generates a Colab-compatible URL using JavaScript evaluation. This comprehensive setup allows developers to quickly establish a working Django environment in Colab, ready for further development of the e-commerce marketplace backend, including defining models, views, and URLs for product management, shopping cart functionality, and user authentication.
